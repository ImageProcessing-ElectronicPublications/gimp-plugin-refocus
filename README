The Refocus Gimp plug-in can be used to sharpen images.  Frequently,
when processing images, e.g. scanning photo's or slides, the images
become slightly blurred.  This plug-in attempts to "refocus" the
image.  In many cases this plug-in produces much better results than
plug-ins such as sharpen or unsharp mask.

This plug-in has a preview that helps you select the best parameters.

This version of the plug-in needs the Gtk+-2.0 libraries.

You can find instructions for installing and using Refocus
in the files doc.html or doc.pdf in the doc subdirectory.

This is the first public release of this plug-in.  I hope you like it.
If you have any problems or requests please mail me.
