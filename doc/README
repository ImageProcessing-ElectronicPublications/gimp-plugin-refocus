This directory contains the plug-in documentation.
Thanks to the miracles of DocBook it contains both an
html and a pdf version.

If you would like to rebuild the documentation you need to have
docbook-tools (version 0.6.9), openjade (version 1.3.1) and Norman
Walsh's XSL stylesheets (version 1.49) installed.  The current
Makefile uses the xsltproc xslt processor from libxslt, but you should
be able to replace it with any other good xslt program.
