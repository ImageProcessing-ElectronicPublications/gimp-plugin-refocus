/* Buffer to hold image data.
   The central part of the buffer contains one row of tiles.
   Around the central part a border is added. The size of the
   border is at least border_width that is equal to the radius
   of the convolution matrix. The size of the border at the top and
   at the left side of the buffer is equal to border_width.
   The top border contain the contents of the previous row of tiles.
   The bottom border has a height equal to the height of one tile and
   acts as a buffer for the next row of tiles.
   The central part of the buffer has a width that is equal to the width
   of the image. The left and the right border have width border_width
   and contain zero's.
   Coordinates of pixels are so arranged that the first point of the
   central image data (that lies at an offset (border_width, border_width)
   from the start) has coordinates (x,y) in the original image.
