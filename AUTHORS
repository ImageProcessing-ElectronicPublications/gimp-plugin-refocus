This plug-in was written by Ernst Lippe <ernstl@users.sourceforge.net>.

The GimpPreview widget is based on the original version by Shawn
T. Amundson.

Some of the code in the plug-in was borrowed from the Gimp Convolution
plug-in by Lauri Alanko.

The CLAPACK functions in lib were developed in the LAPACK and CLAPACK
projects (http://www.netlib.org/clapack).
