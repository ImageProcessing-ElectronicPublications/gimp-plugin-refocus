automatically generated from the DocBook source. The doc.html and doc.pdf
versions of these instructions in the doc directory are more readable.

Installation

Requirements

For installing refocus you need the following:

     * The Gimp, of course. This plug-in should work with versions > 1.2.
     * Gtk+-2 plus pkg-config.
     * Optional: ATLAS, see Using ATLAS

   Installation should be simple. Untar the distribution. If you want to
   use ATLAS install it in lib-atlas (see Using ATLAS).

   Then run ./configure in the top-level directory.

   Then run make install-bin if you want to install the plug-in under
   your home directory or make install-admin-bin if you want to install
   the plug-in under your Gimp's system directory.

   If you have gtk-doc installed you can build the system documentation
   in the gtk-doc directory. In this case you must invoke configure with
   the --enable-gtk-doc option. When you make it for the first time make
   will fail with the message No rule to make target `tmpl/*.sgml'.
   Running make again will fix this problem.

Using ATLAS

What is ATLAS

ATLAS (see http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net) is a system for generating
high-performance mathematical libraries. It generates a library that is
specifically tuned to your processor and compiler. refocus needs some
routines for solving a linear system of equations. By default refocus uses
an unoptimized version from the CLAPACK distribution (see
http://www.netlib.org/clapack).

How to use ATLAS

     * Make ATLAS generate its libraries. For instructions see the ATLAS
       documentation. Depending on your system, this may take a long
       time. During the installation you have to select a name to
       identify your configuration. In the following examples we will use
       Linux_PII as the chosen name.
     * Go to the subdirectory lib/Linux_PII and run make.

cd lib/Linux_PII
make

       This will generate a gzipped tar file that contains the generated
       libraries and include files.
     * Copy the gzipped tar file to the refocus directory and unpack it.

cp ~/ATLAS/lib/atlas3.4.1_Linux_PII.tgz ~/refocus
cd ~/refocus
zcat atlas3.4.1_Linux_PII.tgz |tar xvf -
mv Linux_PII lib-atlas

     * If you have already run configure , you must delete the file
       config.cache.
     * Then run configure. If everything is OK you should see a message
       like using atlas in lib-atlas/lib.
     * Now run make.
